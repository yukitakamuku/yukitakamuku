# Hi, I’m Yuki 👋

I’m a builder who moves between **live production** and **systems engineering** — from cameras and sound at events to CAD, networking, electronics, and web work.

- 📸 **Photo / Video**
- 📡 **Live Streaming** (Camera Operator)
- 🎚️ **PA / Audio**
- 💡 **Lighting / Production**
- 🧩 **CAD • Networking • Electronics • Web**
- 🎓 **B3** | 📍 **Maebashi, Gunma (JP)**

---

## What I’m into

- **Live AV workflows**: reliable setups, clean routing, low-latency monitoring, and repeatable operations
- **Systems & infra**: self-hosting, Docker, storage/backup design, secure remote access
- **Electronics & embedded**: microcontrollers, sensors, IO control, tools for real-world production
- **Web**: building practical tools and sites; consulting on structure, operations, and automation

---

## Tech I use

**Languages**
- Python
- HTML / CSS

**Tools & Platforms**
- Docker / Linux
- Networking (routing, VPN, reverse proxy)
- CAD (mechanical / enclosure design)

---

## Projects (highlights)

- 🎛️ **AV / Production tools** — utilities and scripts to reduce friction in on-site operation
- 🗄️ **Self-hosted services** — storage, backups, and secure access patterns
- 🔧 **Embedded prototypes** — small hardware that connects “the real world” to software

> I’ll add pinned repos here as the projects mature.

## Notes

- I value **reliability**, **simple operations**, and **clean documentation**.
- Open to collaborations around live production tooling, automation, and practical systems.
