Hi, I’m Yuki 👋

I’m a builder who moves between live production and systems engineering — from cameras and sound at events to CAD, networking, electronics, and web work.
	•	📸 Photo / Video
	•	📡 Live Streaming (Camera Operator)
	•	🎚️ PA / Audio
	•	💡 Lighting / Production
	•	🧩 CAD • Networking • Electronics • Web
	•	🎓 B3 | 📍 Maebashi, Gunma (JP)

⸻

What I’m into
	•	Live AV workflows: reliable setups, clean routing, low-latency monitoring, and repeatable operations
	•	Systems & infra: self-hosting, Docker, storage/backup design, secure remote access
	•	Electronics & embedded: microcontrollers, sensors, IO control, tools for real-world production
	•	Web: building practical tools and sites; consulting on structure, operations, and automation

⸻

Tech I use

Languages
	•	Python
	•	HTML / CSS

Tools & Platforms
	•	Docker / Linux
	•	Networking (routing, VPN, reverse proxy)
	•	CAD (mechanical / enclosure design)

⸻

Projects (highlights)
	•	🎛️ AV / Production tools — utilities and scripts to reduce friction in on-site operation
	•	🗄️ Self-hosted services — storage, backups, and secure access patterns
	•	🔧 Embedded prototypes — small hardware that connects “the real world” to software

I’ll add pinned repos here as the projects mature.
